# System-Status
A simple bash script :D

# What the script does
This script will show your system's information on a linux OS
this includes listing the following

Your systems architecture
The number of physical CPU's
The number of virtual CPU's
The amount of RAM and the RAM usage
The amount of disc space and the usage
The CPU load "CPU usage"
The last boot was "when it was last started/turned on"
Tells you if LVM is being used "Logical Volume Manager"
Shows the amount of current TCP connections
Shows the amount of user's logged in
Shows the network IP/IP's
show's the amount of commands being used by a sudo user
including sudo commands being ran by the system "doesn't show what commands"

# How it could be useful
This script can be really useful, especially when you're renting
or buying a server from a server host you are not familier with
to make sure you're getting what you're paying for as alot of hosts
tend to leave out storage space when creating your server and sometime
even RAM

# What you could change
if you would like this to broadcast across your system then you can change
echo to wall just before #Architecture

if you know what you're doing you can even add to this script for check
other system functions or hardware
